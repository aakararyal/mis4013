        <strong>My favorite TV Show is Game of Thrones.</strong> I enjoyed the world-building it does throughout the seasons and all the plot twists that occur throughout the show which make it unpredictable. The show, at least for the first 6 seasons, did a good job in developing all of its main cast to the point where all characters were interesting and felt needed. Furthermore, you could understand their motivations for the actions they take throughout the series.

      <div class="accordion-body">
        <strong>Stranger things is another one of my favorite shows. </strong> It takes place in the 80's which is unique for a show being filmed in the present and it has a great mix of mystery, adventure, and mild horror which keeps you hooked. It does a good job of getting you invested into all the characters as they tackle taking down terrifying creatures that are being controlled by foreign leaders leading to a sense of fear and excitement over what may happen next. All of the actors are very good in the show which helps add to its charm.

       Attack on Titan

    </h2>
    <div id="collapseThree" class="accordion-collapse collapse" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample">
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <strong>Attack on Titan is one of the more recent shows I have watched.</strong> This show stands out to me as it is an anime which is something I don't typically watch, but it differs from most anime for its unique story-telling and world-building. At the beginning of the show, there are many questions you have about what is going on in the show, and by the end I felt that all my questions had been answered in a way that was unique ways possible. The main character Eren stands out to me for his intense character development in the show. It is done well to the point where the Eren from season 1 vs Eren from season 4 are two completely different people, but it felt done right.

        <strong>The Flash is one of the first non-cartoons I remember watching as they air episodes.</strong> In my opinion, this show excels in its first 3 seasons as it takes you through the superhero life of the main character Barry Allen who works as a forensic scientist and superhero. The villains throughout the first 3 seasons are portrayed very well and many unpredictable plot twists keep you hooked. Lastly, Barry's superspeed is exciting to see with special effects in the show.
